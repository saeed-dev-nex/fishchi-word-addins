# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed

Two critical issues have been resolved:

1. **✅ Login Persistence** - No more multiple refreshes needed after login
2. **✅ Data Loading** - Sources and notes now load correctly (fixed 404 errors)

---

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Rebuild
```bash
cd Fishchi-addin
npm run build:dev
```

### Step 2: Open in Word
1. Open Microsoft Word
2. Go to **Home** → **Show Taskpane**
3. Right-click inside task pane → **Inspect** (to see console)

### Step 3: Test
1. **If already logged in:** Close and reopen the task pane
   - ✅ Should see main workspace immediately (no refresh!)
   
2. **If not logged in:** Click "Login" and complete the login
   - ✅ After login, close and reopen - should work immediately

3. **Test data loading:**
   - Select a project from dropdown
   - ✅ Sources should display (check console - no 404 errors)
   - Click on a source
   - ✅ Notes should load automatically
   - Click on a note
   - ✅ Note should insert into Word document

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All of these should work:
- [ ] No manual refresh needed after login
- [ ] No 404 errors in console
- [ ] Sources display when project selected
- [ ] Notes display when source clicked
- [ ] Notes insert into Word document
