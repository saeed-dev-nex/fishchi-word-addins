## 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - Action Required

### The Main Issue (Bug #13)
Your login was failing with the error:
> "AuthProvider: Login process failed. API request failed but reported success"

**Root Cause:** Your server returns `{status: "success", data: {...}}` but the code expected `{success: true, data: {...}}`

**Fix Applied:** Updated API response handler to support both formats and automatically unwrap the `data` field.

---

## 🚀 Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Rebuild the Add-in
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

### Step 2: Refresh in Word
1. Close the task pane if it's open
2. Click **Home** → **Show Task Pane**
3. Click **ورود به حساب کاربری** (Login)

### Step 3: Verify Success
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
✅ AuthProvider: Login successful! کاربر تست
✅ Profile validation passed!
```

## 🐛 If Something Still Doesn't Work

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Red error messages
- What step of login failed
- What the actual server response looks like

### 2. Check Network Tab
- Is the request being sent?
- What status code (200, 401, 404, 500)?
- What does the response body contain?

### 3. Verify Server Configuration
Your server should:
- Be running on `https://localhost:5000`
- Have CORS enabled for `https://localhost:3500`
- Return responses with `status: "success"` and `data: {...}`
- Have valid HTTPS certificates

### 4. Common Quick Fixes

**"Module not found"**
```bash
npm install
```

**"Port already in use"**
```bash
# Change port in package.json or kill the process
```

**"Certificate error"**
```bash
npm run dev-server
# Accept the certificate warning in browser
```

**"Old code still running"**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear cache in DevTools
- Restart Word
