- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No webpack errors

### Step 3: Test in Word

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Already Logged In
**Setup:**
- You logged in previously
- Token exists in storage

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Close the task pane
2. [ ] Reopen the task pane
3. [ ] **Verify:** Main workspace appears immediately (NO refresh needed!)

**Expected Console Output:**
```
AppWrapper: Rendering with isOfficeInitialized = false
AppWrapper: Setting up Office.onReady listener...
Office.onReady() called, updating state.
AppWrapper: Rendering with isOfficeInitialized = true
AuthProvider: Office is ready. Checking login status...
Token found in storage.
AuthProvider: Token validated. User is logged in. [username]
```

### Test 2: Fresh Login
**Setup:**
- Not logged in yet

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Open add-in
2. [ ] Click "Login" button
3. [ ] Complete login in dialog
4. [ ] Close task pane
5. [ ] Reopen task pane
6. [ ] **Verify:** Main workspace appears immediately (NO refresh needed!)

### Test 3: No Token (Clean State)
**Setup:**
- Clear storage first

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Open DevTools console
2. [ ] Run: `await OfficeRuntime.storage.removeItem("fishchi-token")`
3. [ ] Refresh add-in
4. [ ] **Verify:** Login screen appears immediately

**Expected Console Output:**
```
AuthProvider: Office is ready. Checking login status...
No token in storage.
AuthProvider: No token found.
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Must Pass All:
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No webpack build errors
- [ ] No console errors when opening add-in
- [ ] Main workspace appears immediately after reopening (if logged in)
- [ ] Login screen appears immediately (if not logged in)
- [ ] **NO REFRESH NEEDED** at any point
- [ ] Console logs show proper initialization flow

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: Build Fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build:dev
```

### Issue: Old Code Still Running
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh in Word: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Close and reopen Word completely
3. Clear browser cache in DevTools (Application ‚Üí Clear storage)

### Issue: Still Shows Login Screen
**Check:**
1. [ ] Is the build actually running the new code?
2. [ ] Check console - does it show "AppWrapper: Rendering"?
3. [ ] Check console - does it show "Office.onReady() called, updating state"?
4. [ ] Check if token exists: `await OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem("fishchi-token")`

### Issue: Console Shows Errors
**What to do:**
1. Copy the full error message
2. Check which file/line the error is in
3. Verify the file matches the fixed version
4. Check if there are TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`

## üìã Verification Checklist

After rebuilding, verify:

### Code Level:
- [ ] `index.tsx` uses `AppWrapper` component
- [ ] `isOfficeInitialized` is React state (not plain variable)

- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint errors

### Runtime Level:
- [ ] Add-in loads without errors
- [ ] Console shows correct initialization sequence
- [ ] Login persists across sessions
- [ ] No refresh needed after login
- [ ] Token validation works correctly

### User Experience:
- [ ] Smooth, predictable behavior
- [ ] No confusion about login state
- [ ] Professional, polished experience

## üìä Expected Timeline

- **Build:** 30 seconds - 2 minutes
- **First test:** 2-3 minutes
- **Full testing:** 10-15 minutes
- **Total time:** ~20 minutes

---

## üéØ Final Validation

Once all tests pass:

- [ ] Test with your actual backend server
- [ ] Test login flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test logout and re-login
- [ ] Test closing/reopening Word
- [ ] Test on a fresh machine (if possible)
- [ ] Consider it **PRODUCTION READY** ‚úÖ

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the console logs** - they're very detailed
2. **Read `FIX_REFRESH_ISSUE.md`** - has troubleshooting guide
3. **Check `BUG_FIXES.md`** - lists all known issues and fixes
4. **Verify API responses** - use Network tab in DevTools

**Status:** Ready to test
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Low (simple fix, big impact)
**Risk:** Very low (isolated change, well-tested pattern)

‚úÖ **You're good to go! Just rebuild and test.**
