# Fix Summary: Refresh Issue After Login

## 🎯 Problem You Reported

> "When I open the add-in for the first time, if I was logged in before, I have to refresh the add-in several times for it to work."

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

There was a **race condition** in the Office initialization code:

1. Your add-in would render before Office.js finished loading
2. The authentication check would never run because it was waiting for Office to be ready
3. Even though you had a valid token stored, the add-in didn't check for it
4. You'd see the login screen instead of your workspace
5. Refreshing multiple times would eventually work (by luck of timing)

**Root Cause:** Used a plain JavaScript variable instead of React state for tracking Office initialization.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**File Changed:** `src/taskpane/index.tsx`

**The Fix:**
- Converted initialization logic to use React state (`useState`)
- Now when Office becomes ready, React properly detects the change
- Authentication check runs automatically
- Stored token is validated
- You see the main workspace immediately

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### 1. Rebuild the Add-in
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

### 2. Test It
1. **If already logged in:** Close and reopen the task pane
   - **Expected:** Main workspace appears immediately ✅
   - **No refresh needed!**

2. **If not logged in:** Click "Login"
   - Complete login
   - Close task pane
   - Reopen task pane
   - **Expected:** Main workspace appears immediately ✅

### 3. Verify in Console
Open DevTools (Right-click → Inspect) and look for:

```
✅ Good - Should see this:
Office.onReady() called, updating state.
AuthProvider: Office is ready. Checking login status...
Token found in storage.
AuthProvider: Token validated. User is logged in.
```
